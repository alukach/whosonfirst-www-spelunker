# whosonfirst-www-spelunker

A simple Flask-based spelunker for poking around Who's On First data (stored in [PostGIS](https://github.com/mapzen/py-mapzen-whosonfirst-spatial) and [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/mapzen/py-mapzen-whosonfirst-search)).

This is still a **work in progress**.

## Data

This assumes two data sources:

* A PostGIS database with data imported using [py-mapzen-whosonfirst-spatial]()
* An ElasticSearch database with data imported using [py-mapzen-whosonfirst-search]()
